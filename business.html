      <h2>Ambience Setup</h2>
      <p>Comfort calms the mind... One of the ways of reaping maximum benefits from a meetup is to acknowlegde everyone's ideas.
          A comfort atmosphere makes this easy. Our goal is to setup a room or a place which vibes exactly with you and your members personality... 
          Some of the facilities we provide include AC setup, conference table, chairs, projector, whiteboard and an amazing view if you want to choose a place.
          If you want to conduct in your building or place, we provide materials and covers for chairs, tables, audio facilities and much more...

      <h2>Rendezvous and RSVPs</h2>
      <p>Organizing a meetup doesn't just end with creating a Whatsapp Group for all the members.
          Wish it was that easy... But you don't have to worry about sending phone numbers, timings
          for the invite. We have got it all covered. Our team will be personally assisting and handling all the requirements.
          Some of our team's work would be sending emails to all members in the list, recieving membership forms, creating a reminder for them and 
          storing all this information properly.

      <p>One of the ways of starting off on the right foot with your members or your business
          partners is ending the meeting with a proper meal. We provide Menu Selection, Wine/Mocktails Tasting.
          We can source anything you'll need from - dining table, table covers to your choice of Restuarant.
